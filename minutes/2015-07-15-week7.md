NOTES  
-------------------------

### Week 7 Report:
  Integration of the Chrome Application skeleton (which enables downloading
  files to specified folder on client's file system in the required hierarchy
  structure) with the already implemented browser-based code which performs
  fetching and parsing of the tar file on-the-fly  

  **Chrome Application - Current state-of-art**: Implementation details:

  - Gives user a choice to select the folder path to download the collection
  - Stores this path in Chrome local storage and recursively creates
  sub-directories within this folder as per the manifest schema (manifest
  hardcoded right now for the particular collection)
  - Maintains a record in Chrome local storage for the location of particular
  subdirectories viz., `collection`, `patientID`, `studyUID`, `seriesUID`
  - On clicking "Download files", it fetches tar file from the server (tar file
  hosted locally, not served directly from cancerimagingarchive.net as of now)
  - Parses this tar file with on-the-fly approach, and for each entry in the tar
  file it downloads that file to user specified directory with the hierarchy of
  files and folders maintained as per the manifest.
  - On successful download, it inserts a record in Minimongo DB (backed by
  IndexedDB) to maintain records of successful downloads in case of failure
  - The above mentioned processes are done sequentially for a particular series
  i.e. only when an entry is downloaded and record is inserted in the DB, we
  proceed to the next entry in tar.  

  - Demonstration: Chrome Application *.crx* file [here](http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~tejas.shah/gsoc15/merge-browser-app.crx)
  (For installation: Download, drag-and-drop to the chrome://extensions/ page)

### Roadmap Ahead
  - With the Chrome Application in place, we now need to invoke this Chrome
  Application from a web page and pass content (manifest) to the App from the
  web page.
  - *Tools* to be used: [`url_handlers`](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/url_handlers)
  for invoking Chrome App from a web page, [`Content scripts`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts)
  to inject JS into the web page and [`Messaging`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/messaging#external-webpage)
  for communication between Chrome Application and the web page
  - Discuss the remaining work breakdown for the next 5 weeks

### [Post-Discussion] TO DOs
  - We cannot directly pass on the manifest contents to the Chrome App from the
  cancerimagingarchive.net website because some collections need userId and
  password credentials along with user specified `includeAnnotations` flag
  - So we pass the .jnlp file URL to the Chrome Application, parse and extract
  necessary properties viz., `includeAnnotations`, `userId`, `password`,
  `downloadServerUrl` and `argument` (for the `serverjnlpfileloc` attribute)
  - Once we fetch the above values, we download the manifest from within the
  Chrome App itself, and then proceed as before
  - Communication between web page and Chrome Application needs to be explored
  - Work breakdown structure discussion emphasized that we better get a single
  streaming fully working Chrome Application in place and then we can include
  Web Workers implementation for parallel streaming, if time permits
