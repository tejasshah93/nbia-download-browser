NOTES  
-------------------------

### Week 5 - 6 Report:
  - Drop the former idea of changing browser settings followed by execution of
  the script for downloading the collection and go for the Chrome Application
  instead. Basically, it came out of discussions that the former option is not
  much better than the current Java Web Start based program.  

  **Chrome Application skeleton**: Download Files to user specified directory
  with the tree structure of files and folders maintained as per the manifest.  
  Implementation details:
  - Getting aquainted with development of Chrome Application
  - Gives user a choice to select the folder path
  - Stores this path in Chrome local storage and recursively creates
  sub-directories within this folder as per the manifest schema
  - Maintains a record in Chrome local storage for the location of particular
  subdirectories viz., `collection`, `patientID`, `studyUID`, `seriesUID`
  - On clicking "download", the application downloads 4 dummy files with
  different content to the specified seriesUID folder  

  - Demonstration: Chrome Application *.crx* file [here](http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~tejas.shah/gsoc15/nbia-chrome-app.crx)    
  (For installation: Download, drag-and-drop to the chrome://extensions/ page)

### Roadmap Ahead
  - Integrate this skeleton with already implemented browser-based code which
  performs fetching and parsing of the tar file on-the-fly  
  *Possbile hurdles:* Compatibility of `Browserify` modules with Chrome
  Application  

  - Download the thus parsed files from the tar to the user selected directory
  entry with appropriate tree structure maintained

### [Post-Discussion] TO DOs
  - As discussed carry on the mentioned points in the Roadmap section above and
  try to get a working, integrated version of Chrome Application
